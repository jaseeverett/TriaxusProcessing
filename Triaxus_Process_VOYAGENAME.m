% This script is the master control for the processing of Triaxus data.
% Here we set the names of all the input files - LOPC, CTD (scan) and
% EcoTriplet - and the output directories.
% 
% We do some preliminary processing of the CTD scan data to remove
% obviously bad data, but since this is still prelimiary data from during
% the voyage, we don't spend much time. We are more interested in broad
% features and large scale changes in oceanography to relate to plankton
% data.
% 
% This script will call a range of other functions which will individually
% process each input file, and then merge all the outputs into a single
% MATLAB structure which is appended to the .mat file. 
% 
% When you have finished running Triaxus_Process_VOYAGENAME.m and you have
% the output file for each deployment, you can run setup and run
% Triaxus_2DPlot_VOYAGENAME.m to get the spatial plot.
% 
% This code requires that the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox is installed and the
% GSW_Oceanographic toolbox is installed (http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm).
